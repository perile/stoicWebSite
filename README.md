# stoicWebSite
This is a training website, so that I can test out my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The result is very simple, minimalistic and maybe a bit outdated.
It has been optimized (big word, given the results!) for smartphone screens, except for the "List of All Quotes" page, where a table is output directly into a div through Javascript, but I have not been able to better design it, which ends up looking a bit janky.

Some of the code I have been able to find somewhere else, like W3Schools for the navbar, the javascript for the table in "List of All Quotes" was found on techieclues, but I did my best so that it was adapted to the context of this website. 

Other than that, as my first "full-fledged" website, I did what I could, and hopefully there is more to come.

Possibly I will clean up the code a bit better and maybe add a bit more of functionality.

Note that I do not own any of the pictures presented here, nor can I be certain that the quotes outputed were actually said by these authors, except for some cases. Like Aristotle once said: 'Don't believe everything on the internet'.
