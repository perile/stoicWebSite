    <h1>What is Stoicism?</h1>

    <p>Stoicism is a philosophical doctrine founded by Zeno of Citium, in the 3rd century BC. It orbits around the notion that there are two realms in life: the external one and the internal.</p>
    <p>The external realm is referent to the things we cannot control, such as outside events, the opinions of others, the results of our actions, and so on.</p>
    <p>The internal realm is, instead, everything we can control: our own thoughts, our reactions, decisions, perspectives, etc.</p>
    <p>Given this, it becomes easy to understand that Stoicism relies on the ideia that our perception of the world will, in a way, dictate the way we feel. Many stoic authors insist that it is often the way we interpret things that makes us unhappy, and not the event itself. Intrisincaly, things cannot make us sad or angry, but how we perceive them.</p>
    <p>Stoicism is going through it's rennassaince, given the attention it is getting as of late. More and more communities are being formed around this philosophical doctrine, and ancient books and texts from classical authors are making a strong comeback. It is presumed that more people will get into stoicism, or at least being thought provoking enough, to get into other themes in philosophy.</p>
